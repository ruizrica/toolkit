  "original_request": "Implement a 6-wave plan to extend agent-memory CLI with tree-based code navigation using tree-sitter AST parsing, FTS beam-search navigation, and new CLI commands.",
  "current_task": "All 6 waves implemented, tests passing (108 total), merged to main, docs updated — work is complete.",
  "key_files": [
    "/Users/ricardo/Workshop/GitHub/agent-toolkit/tools/agent-memory/src/agent_memory/parser.py",
    "/Users/ricardo/Workshop/GitHub/agent-toolkit/tools/agent-memory/src/agent_memory/tree.py",

  ],
  "continuation_prompt": "All 6 waves of the code navigation feature are complete and merged to main (16 commits ahead of origin). New modules: parser.py (tree-sitter AST extraction for Python/TS/JS), tree.py (SQLite code_nodes storage with FTS5), code_indexer.py (discover/parse/store pipeline with change detection), navigator.py (FTS beam search width=3), summarizer.py (fallback summaries from signatures+docstrings). CLI has 5 new commands: code-index, code-nav, code-tree, code-refs, code-summarize. All 108 tests pass (73 new). Docs updated across README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/commands, docs/skills, plugins. Note: tree-sitter is installed under python3.11 (--user), not python3 (which is 3.14 via Homebrew). Some existing tests fail due to missing fastembed dep — pre-existing, not caused by our changes. If user wants to push, run 'git push' from main."
